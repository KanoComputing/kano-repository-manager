**dr** (stands for debian repository) is a Debian repository management tool.
It will help you set up and maintain your own small package repository for any
Debian-based distribution. You can keep your sources in **git** and use the
**dr** tool to manage builds, versions, and releases. It works particularly
well in case your development is very fast and you ship new versions of
your packages often (even several times a day).

The following diagram illustrates how `dr` works. It takes source packages
that are managed in git repositories, builds them and serves them in
different suites. For more information, please see this
[project's wiki](https://github.com/KanoComputing/kano-package-system/wiki).

It is the tool we use to manage our software repository and the custom
packages for **Kano OS**. The application is written in **Ruby**, building
on top of many other tools (such as reprepro, debuild, debhelper, and others).

Here is like it looks like in the terminal:

## Requirements

In order to generate new build roots you will require `debootstrap`. A bug in
versions prior to 1.0.72 would cause issues with unpacking packages in a
foreign environment before processing Pre-Depends, causing packages to fail to
install. To avoid this issue, ensure that you are using `debootstrap >= 1.0.72`.
